    <H1 style="color: seagreen;"> My Winter Break</H1>
<p style="color: brown;">
    I did not do all lot of productive things these
 past two weeks. For christmas, I got new clothes, games to play, a speaker 
 to play music, and a new pair of shoes. I am really <em>grateful</em> for everything 
 that I got that day I spent some time with my family, but I mostly ate and
  played with my cousins all break long. <strong>My older brother
 got me RE4 for christmas, so I played that during my winter break as well.</strong>
 I also played many family games with my family and watched movies with 
 them too. I called and chatted my old friends from middle school too. They
 all seem to be doing well.

After 3 years, I finally got my braces off and I couldn't be <em>happier</em>. My family and I stayed up until midnight to 
celebrate new years and disscused new year reselutions. My uncle told us that he wanted 
to go to Europe. One of my new year reselutions was to get straight As 2nd semester and
1st semester in my sophomore year. We didn't do anything else that day, but me and my 
cousin created end of the year paintings the day before. We also went downtown many times 
during my winter break. <strong>We also went to China Town and ate delicious chinese food.</strong> I lost 
my ventra card there though.
